# nix-auto-gpt

As Auto-GPT supports [direnv](https://github.com/nix-community/nix-direnv), upon cloning [Auto-GPT](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT) repository and entering directory, `direnv` will request permission once to automatically load dependencies. To grant permission, enter: `direnv allow`


To manually load dependencies without `direnv`, run:

> nix develop github:superherointj/nix-auto-gpt
